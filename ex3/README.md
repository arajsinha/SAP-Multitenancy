# Exercise 3 - Create Services and Sample Data
## Define the Services for the Defined Entities

### Define Service
We will now project the services for the Entities we previously defined so that our UI is able to access the data we have defined with the Entities.

You will be able to see the Storyboard Page. Click on the '+' symbol on the 'Services' Card in order to create the service.

This will open the 'service.cds' tab and here you can create your service. Click on 'Books' and click 'OK'. This will create the entity card for 'Books'.

Click on 'Add Entity' again for 'Authors'. Click on 'Authors' and click 'OK'. This will create your whole service that you will be able to expose to get your app running.

Now when you go back to the 'Storyboard' page, you will be able to see the 'Services' card filled too.

### Add Sample Data

Now we will add 'Sample Data' so that we have some data on the app to play with. Here you have to click on the 'Open Editor' dropdown and click on the 'Sample Data' option.

Now you can go back to the Storyboard.

Here we have basically defined a service where our previously defined entities have been projected.

### View Service

Click on the green 'Play' Button on the top right corner. This will start your application locally and you can view what you have built till now.

This page will open up. Click on the 'service details' link to view your service details.

As you can see we have the 2 entities we had defined in this metadata.
